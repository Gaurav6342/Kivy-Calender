# Kivy-Calender

Kivy-Calender is a Calender built in python and kivy.

Note:
For PreSplash.
Kivy (actually python-for-android) allows you to set the start screen image for your application (so called presplash). But:

The image size shouldn't be more than max texture size for your device (just google to know it, I always take 1024x1024, as much as it's supported by the majority of the devices).
If it's in png format, it's size should be power of 2 (256x256, 512x512, 1024x1024), just like good old openGL. Both of these limitations are openGL implementation agnonostic, but you never know, if it's good or not.
If it's in jpeg format (which is actually should be the preferred one), you don't have previos limitation, but #1 still counts.
